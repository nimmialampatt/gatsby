We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.","paragraph3":"React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.With that out of the way, let’s get started!","Tips":""},{"title":"Embedding Expressions in JSX","paragraph1":"In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:","paragraph2":"You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.
